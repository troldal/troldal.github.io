The Numerixx library is a collection of functions and classes for numerical computing. Numerixx was developed in C++, with the purpose of providing implementations of the most common numerical algorithms. It is by no means the purpose to be as feature rich as other numerical libraries, such as the GNU Scientific Library (GSL), nor is it the purpose to be as super-optimized for performance as other numerical libraries. Rather, the intent is to provide modern C++ implementations of common numerical algorithms, and make them available as a header-only library, so that it can be integrated easily into client code.

Emphasis have been put on the architecture of the library, so that it is easy to maintain and easy to extend. In many cases, it will be possible for users to use their own custom algorithms, and plug them in to the Numerixx library. Each section will provide guidance for how to extend the library with custom algorithms.

While performance is always a concern, the primary focus of the library is to provide correct and reliable numerical algorithms, with an intuitive interface. Performance is a secondary concern, and the library is not intended to be used for high-performance computing. So if you intend to implement the next-generation weather forecast model, you should probably look elsewhere.
